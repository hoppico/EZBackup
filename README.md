# IndipArchZip
## Generate Archives of individual files in a directory (parent and subs)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Briefly, this tool compresses individual files in a set of directories and sub-directories. You can define your own password, the level of compression, and the filetypes to zip.

When I was backing up my directories, including the images into cloud, I preferred to zip and encrypt them at the same time. To facilitate the upload and download, I preferred to zip individual files, but not the directories. This app does the preferred task, with a core consisted of the popular 7Zip.

I coded this small tool personal purposes, but you can compile it, work, and enjoy it.
Besides, I appreciate those who are interested to continue the implementation.

## Dependencies:
You need:
- 7Zip command file, and DLL
- Qt 5.11.2
- MSVC2017
